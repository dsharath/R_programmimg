# Create a line graph of mean of friendships_initiated per day (of tenure)
# vs. tenure colored by year_joined.bucket.

# You need to make use of the variables tenure,
# friendships_initiated, and year_joined.bucket.

# You also need to subset the data to only consider user with at least
# one day of tenure.

# This assignment is not graded and
# will be marked as correct when you submit.

# ENTER YOUR CODE BELOW THIS LINE
