# Write code to do the following:

# (1) Add another geom_line to code below
# to plot the grand mean of the friend count vs age.

# (2) Exclude any users whose year_joined.bucket is NA.

# (3) Use a different line type for the grand mean.

# As a reminder, the parameter linetype can take the values 0-6:

# 0 = blank, 1 = solid, 2 = dashed
# 3 = dotted, 4 = dotdash, 5 = longdash
# 6 = twodash

# This assignment is not graded and
# will be marked as correct when you submit.

# The code from the last programming exercise should
# be your starter code!

# ENTER YOUR CODE BELOW THIS LINE
