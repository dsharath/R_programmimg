# Write code to create a new data frame,
# called 'pf.fc_by_age_gender', that contains
# information on each age AND gender group.

# The data frame should contain the following variables:

#    mean_friend_count,
#    median_friend_count,
#    n (the number of users in each age and gender grouping)

# Here is an example of the structure of your data frame. Your
# data values will be different. Note that if you are grouping by
# more than one variable, you will probably need to call the
# ungroup() function. 

#   age gender mean_friend_count median_friend_count    n
# 1  13 female          247.2953                 150  207
# 2  13   male          184.2342                  61  265
# 3  14 female          329.1938                 245  834
# 4  14   male          157.1204                  88 1201
