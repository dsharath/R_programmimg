# Plot the ratio of the female to male median
# friend counts using the data frame
# pf.fc_by_age_gender.wide.

# Think about what geom you should use.
# Add a horizontal line to the plot with
# a y intercept of 1, which will be the
# base line. Look up the documentation
# for geom_hline to do that. Use the parameter
# linetype in geom_hline to make the
# line dashed.

# The linetype parameter can take the values 0-6:
# 0 = blank, 1 = solid, 2 = dashed
# 3 = dotted, 4 = dotdash, 5 = longdash
# 6 = twodash

# This assignment is not graded and
# will be marked as correct when you submit.
