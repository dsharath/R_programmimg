# Create a new variable in the data frame
# called year_joined.bucket by using
# the cut function on the variable year_joined.

# You need to create the following buckets for the
# new variable, year_joined.bucket

#        (2004, 2009]
#        (2009, 2011]
#        (2011, 2012]
#        (2012, 2014]

# Note that a parenthesis means exclude the year and a
# bracket means include the year.

# Look up the documentation for cut or try the link
# in the Instructor Notes to accomplish this task.
