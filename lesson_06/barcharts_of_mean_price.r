# Weâ€™ve created summary data frames with the mean price
# by clarity and color. You can run the code in R to
# verify what data is in the variables diamonds_mp_by_clarity
# and diamonds_mp_by_color.

# Your task is to write additional code to create two bar plots
# on one output image using the grid.arrange() function from the package
# gridExtra.

# This assignment is not graded and
# will be marked as correct when you submit.

# See the Instructor Notes for more info on bar charts
# and for a hint on this task.
