# The Gapminder website contains over 500 data sets with information about
# the world's population. Your task is to continue the investigation you did at the
# end of Problem Set 3 or you can start fresh and choose a different
# data set from Gapminder.

# If youâ€™re feeling adventurous or want to try some data munging see if you can
# find a data set or scrape one from the web.

# In your investigation, examine pairs of variable and create 2-5 plots that make
# use of the techniques from Lesson 4.

# You can find a link to the Gapminder website in the Instructor Notes.

# Once you've completed your investigation, create a post in the discussions that includes:
#       1. the variable(s) you investigated, your observations, and any summary statistics
#       2. snippets of code that created the plots
#       3. links to the images of your plots

# Copy and paste all of the code that you used for
# your investigation, and submit it when you are ready.
