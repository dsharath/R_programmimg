# Investigate the price of diamonds using box plots,
# numerical summaries, and one of the following categorical
# variables: cut, clarity, or color.

# There wonâ€™t be a solution video for this
# exercise so go to the discussion thread for either
# BOXPLOTS BY CLARITY, BOXPLOT BY COLOR, or BOXPLOTS BY CUT
# to share you thoughts and to
# see what other people found.

# You can save images by using the ggsave() command.
# ggsave() will save the last plot created.
# For example...
#                  qplot(x = price, data = diamonds)
#                  ggsave('priceHistogram.png')

# ggsave currently recognises the extensions eps/ps, tex (pictex),
# pdf, jpeg, tiff, png, bmp, svg and wmf (windows only).

# Copy and paste all of the code that you used for
# your investigation, and submit it when you are ready.
