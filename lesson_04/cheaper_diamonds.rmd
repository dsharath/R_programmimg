# Explore the largest peak in the

# Try limiting the x-axis, altering the bin width,
# and setting different breaks on the x-axis.

# You can save images by using the ggsave() command.
# ggsave() will save the last plot created.
# For example...
#                  qplot(x = price, data = diamonds)
#                  ggsave('priceHistogram.png')

# ggsave currently recognises the extensions eps/ps, tex (pictex),
# pdf, jpeg, tiff, png, bmp, svg and wmf (windows only).

# Submit your final code when you are ready.
